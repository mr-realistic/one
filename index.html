          The Scorpion Kings are a South African music duo made up of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/djmaphorisa/"> Dj
          Maphorisa</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kabelomotha_/"> Kabza De Small</a>, known for popularizing the Amapiano
          genre. Since teaming up in 2019, they've released hit songs like
          “Abalele,” “eMcimbini,” “Sponono,” and “Lorch.” Their unique blend of
          deep house, kwaito, and jazz influences has made them local legends
          and global pioneers. They've collaborated with major artists and
          played a key role in taking Amapiano to the world stage
