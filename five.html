          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/____.txc.____/">TxC</a> (short for Tarryn and Clair) is a dynamic female DJ duo from South
          Africa making waves in the Amapiano scene. Known for their high-energy
          performances and bold presence, TXC brings both style and skill to the
          decks, representing a fresh and powerful voice in a male-dominated
          space. They’re best known for their viral DJ sets, choreography, and
          fashion-forward image, often blending performance and party into one
          unforgettable experience. Their mixes are rooted in Bacardi-infused
          Amapiano, featuring heavy log drums, catchy rhythms, and street
          bangers that get the crowd moving. TXC have performed on big stages
          across South Africa and internationally, quickly becoming icons for
          young women in music and nightlife culture. While they’ve gained fame
          through their live sets, they’re also stepping deeper into music
          production and collaborations with well-known artists in the scene. In
          short, TXC isn’t just about the music — they’re about movement,
          energy, and representation, showing the world that women can lead and
          dominate in the Amapiano wave too.
