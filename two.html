          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mellow_and_sleazy012/">Mellow and Sleazy</a> are a South African Amapiano producer and DJ duo known for their unique sound called “Bacardi piano” a raw, percussive, and street-inspired style of Amapiano that blends township energy with catchy, minimalist beats. They rose to fame with hits like “Bopha,” “Chipi ke Chipi,” and “10111.”

Their sound is heavily influenced by the Bacardi music culture from Pretoria, which they’ve helped bring into the mainstream through their collaborations and viral tracks. They often work with artists like Felo Le Tee, DJ Maphorisa, and Young Stunna, helping shape the modern direction of Amapiano.

In a short time, Mellow & Sleazy have become key voices in the genre especially among the new wave of piano producers. Their beats are known for being bold, hypnotic, and perfect for turning up in the streets or the club.
